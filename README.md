# Nmap Formatting- SDA Coding Dojo CyberSecurity Bootcamp 

nmap is a tool you have already used many times and although it is a tool we use in pentesting, it is also very useful when assessing the security status of an organization. Sometimes however you might need to export this into different applications. By now you have at least 3 VM's on your machine aside from Kali. One at a time, spin up those machines and do a detailed `nmap scan, -A ` on all ports, for each one. 

**WARNING:** do one at a time or you will crash your machine. 

You will then take the results of EACH nmap output and convert it to `Json`, `CSV`, and `XML`. Each machine you scan should have a regular txt file of the original, `xml`, and csv file. Take all of these files and place them in a folder labeled `"nmap-output-yourname"`. Of course make sure to substitude "yourname" for your actual name. Upload this into your team folder. 

**Hint:** Scripts already exist for this. Do not attempt to write your own scripts for this. You might be able to "git" them from another source. Please list the URL of the source you get your script from.
